## Artifact 1 Appointment Scheduling

[Artifact 1: Appointment Scheduling Repository](https://github.com/Ukuliga/AppointmentScheduler)

1. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

This is a program I originally created in CS320. It is a program that manages appointments, contacts, and tasks for a small business. The program makes classes for each of these and sets up their get and set methods. Once those are all made, I created JUnit tests for each class to ensure functionality.

2. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I included this artifact because it displays my ability to create functional code that adheres to the best coding practice. Specifically I want to show my understanding of object oriented design and creating solution oriented code. I improved the artifact by translating the program to python. This shows my understanding of multiple languages and the use of good coding practices in both. 
3.Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

I planned on meeting the course outcomes of “Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science”, “Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts”, and “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices” I believe I have successfully done this through creating functional code, usable classes, and comments to allow others to help contribute as well. 

4.Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

Reflecting on the process of enhancing this artifact I discovered a few things. I had not done much testing in python before and it is quite a bit different than I expected. They feel very intuitive to me, but that could be from my previous work in python. I believe this has been really good to expand my knowledge of coding and object oriented work.


## Artifact 2 Student Program Use Cases

[Artifact 2: Student Program Use Cases Repository](https://github.com/Ukuliga/StudentScheduleProgram)

1.Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

The artifact I chose for this milestone is the IT315 Use Case diagram, which I originally created in 2022. The diagram initially outlined the relationships between different use cases and the users involved in the system. It created a program based on the use cases.
2.Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in algorithms and data structure? How was the artifact improved?

The reason for this inclusion is to showcase my algorithm I create for this program. It is very important for a developer to create innovative and efficient code that solves the problem that is being set out for them. The aspects of this artifact that showcase my skills are the relation between different files, classes, and inherited traits from other objects. The artifact was improved by adding additional functionality to the original. Not only was it adding functionality but also adds an algorithm that can help the user make decision on their path forward in school.
3.Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-cover

Yes, I believe I met the course outcomes, especially in terms of designing a computing solution, applying algorithmic principles, and ensuring the system delivers specific value to its audience. I also incorporated professional communication through detailed comments and headers in the code. I do not have any updates to my outcome-coverage plans at this time.age plans?
4.Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

Enhancing this artifact stretched my thoughts when trying to create functional code and algorithms to improve the program. It helped that I had the original artifact to build from, but expanding caused some challenges. I then had to iterate through the code to make the algorithm work and provide the functionality I wanted. In the end I am very happy with the result.


## Artifact 3 Database Collaboration
